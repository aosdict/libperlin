.Sh DESCRIPTION
The libperlin library generates Perlin noise (continuous fractal noise) in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions.
.Pp
Perlin noise is generated by combining a series of octaves of smooth noise. Each octave interpolates between random values at a fixed interval. By decreasing this interval for successive octaves and combining the values, complicated but continuous fractal Brownian noise patterns can be generated.
.Pp
.Fn perlin_1d ,
.Fn perlin_2d , and
.Fn perlin_3d
all provide the ability to control the starting and ending octaves, which is an indirect control over the size of the patterns generated by the noise.
.Fa octave_begin
and
.Fa octave_end
must be non-negative, with octave_begin <= octave_end.
.Pp
The
.Fa persistence
argument is the factor by which the magnitude of each successive octave is diminished. A common value is 0.5, under which every octave contributes half as much to the noise as the previous.
.Pp
.Fn get_perlin_minmax
is used to determine the largest and smallest possible values of noise for a given range of octaves and persistence.
.Pp
Perlin noise is based on psuedorandom numbers, but it also has to be repeatable. Calling a Perlin noise function twice with the same parameters will return the same number. You can seed the noise generator by calling 
.Fn set_perlin_seed .
The library makes no calls to
.Fn srand
or
.Fn rand .
.Pp
Perlin noise itself can be generated in any number of dimensions, but libperlin only supports up to three at this point.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn perlin_1d ,
.Fn perlin_2d ,
and
.Fn perlin_3d
functions return the summed Perlin noise value at the given coordinate(s) across the given octaves. 
.Pp
.Fn get_perlin_minmax
stores the maximum and minimum possible values for a given octave range and persistence in its
.Fa min
and
.Fa max
arguments.
